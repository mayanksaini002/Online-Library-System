Online Library System :-

* This is my online library system built using React. The project allows users to browse, search, and view details about books available in the library. I developed an interactive web application that simulates a real-world library environment.

Features :-

1) Book Listing: Users can view a list of all available books.

2) Book Details: Click on any book to see detailed information, such as the author, category, and a short description.

3) Search Functionality: Easily search for books by title or author.


How It Works :-

1) Home Page: The home page displays a list of books fetched . Each book is displayed as a card with its title, and author.

2) Book Detail Page: When a user clicks on a book card, they are taken to a detailed page showing all relevant information about the book.

3) Search: A search bar is provided at the Browse books page. Users can type in a keyword to filter the displayed books based on the title or author.

4) Navigation: A simple header is available for easy navigation between pages (home, etc.).
